# INCircleView - lightweight component for drawing progress or indicator circles.

I wrote a similar component in Objective C for a project a while ago and decided to rewrite it recently for a project in Swift with some updates and many bug fixes. You can set a number of parameters in IB to customise the circles and their behaviour.

## Installation

Just add the INCircleView.swift to your project and you're good to go.

## Usage

See the sample project for usage examples. Main thing to note is that all of the values are 0 to 1. This is to make it easily compatible with the progress values without the need to convert to angles/radians.
